Phone, wallet, keys. This is the thought that goes through my head, consciously or unconsciously, every time I leave a location. 
Each year, my cross country team goes on a team retreat up in the mountains of South Carolina. We stay at the South Carolina camp of blind, a wonderful little compound tucked away in the scenic Appalachin mountains. Any blind citizen of the state of South Carolina is allowed to stay there free of charge any time during the year but we get a discounted rate because our coach has an in. I've come to really love this yearly retreat for many reasons, but one of the best believe it or not is the lack of internet and cell service. For the first 18 years or so my team has been coming here, there was absolutely no cell service or internet. My freshman year they added an internet router to the cabins but I've made it a point to not connect to it. Apart from a rather stressful experience this year when my university threw on an erroneous charge to my account the day before everything was due it's been an absolutely liberating experience having almost no connection to the outside world. While I'm up there not only is there no service but everything like meals is already provided for me ultimately meaning whenever I go somewhere new I don't need to bring anything with me, not even my phone, wallet, keys. The first day is always jarring, I'll find myself leaving the cabin in the morning instinctively patting my pockets to make sure I have what I need only to realize the error in my ways. After a day or so though I become accustomed to this new way of being. It's a surprisingly liberating experience to have something come up and not have to worry about what I need to bring but instead just go. 
This experience speaks to the larger point of what we as humans let sap our most precious resource, our attention. As a computer scientist, I like to think of phenomenon like phone, wallet, keys as daemons for our mind. If you don't know what a daemon is in the world of operating systems, they're background processes that are always running and only come to light when some event is triggered, like leaving the house. Actually the analogy of the operating system is more poignant than I realized because our mind, or consciousness, can be thought of as the linux of the human experience. Whenever one frees up one of the background processes our personal operating system has more available compute to perform the operations we need it to. 
Another grand example of this phenomenon everyone is likely already aware of is social media and technology at large. Enough has been said on this topic so I think I'll leave it there.
